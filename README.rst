Keras-ResNet is **the** Keras package for deep residual networks. It's fast *and* flexible.

A tantalizing preview of Keras-ResNet simplicity:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import tensorflow.keras

    >>> import keras_resnet.models

    >>> shape, classes = (32, 32, 3), 10

    >>> x = tensorflow.keras.layers.Input(shape)

    >>> model = keras_resnet.models.ResNet50(x, classes=classes)

    >>> model.compile("adam", "categorical_crossentropy", ["accuracy"])

    >>> (training_x, training_y), (_, _) = tensorflow.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

    >>> training_y = tensorflow.keras.utils.np_utils.to_categorical(training_y)

    >>> model.fit(training_x, training_y)

Installation
------------

Installation couldnâ€™t be easier:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install keras-resnet

#. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug. There is a `Contributor Friendly`_ tag for issues that should be ideal for people who are not very familiar with the codebase yet.
#. Fork `the repository`_ on GitHub to start making your changes to the **master** branch (or branch off of it).
#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.
#. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. :) Make sure to add yourself to AUTHORS_.
